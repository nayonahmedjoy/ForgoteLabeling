        * **Scoped.** Deletion goes through ``backend.delete_project(id)``, which
          only ever touches keys under that one project's prefix, so a sweep can
          never remove another project's objects.
        * **Idempotent.** Only projects whose stored deadline has passed are
          removed, and an already-deleted project simply is not listed on the
          next run, so repeated calls converge and report ``deleted: 0``.
        * **Complete.** The backend removes *all* of the project's objects
          (metadata.json, images.json, labels.json, annotations.json and every
          image blob); metadata is not dropped until the rest is handled, so a
