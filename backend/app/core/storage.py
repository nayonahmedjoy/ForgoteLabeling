"""Centralized filesystem layout and JSON helpers.

Every service derives its paths from here so storage is consistent and
independent of the current working directory. The layout for one project:

    uploads/<project_id>/
        metadata.json          project metadata
        images.json            persistent image index (source of truth)
        labels.json            project labels / classes
        images/                image files
        thumbnails/            reserved for future thumbnails
        export/                generated export artifacts
        annotations/
            annotations.json   bounding-box annotations for the project
